> design patterns?

- these are good solutions for common programming problems

- singleton
  - one instance class
  - for example we can store configuration values in singleton class
- abstract factory
  - can create different class instances with common interface function
  - in C++ it is possible to add concrete classes with shared libraries without changing abstract factory code
- Pimpl idiom (pointer to implementation idiom) aka opaque pointer
  - allows additiotest phraseion of interface from implementation
    - Luxoft -> Citi -> `dosa` -> `dosa_publisher` -> `ProtoPublisher`
    - Qt
