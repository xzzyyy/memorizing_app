## optimization

---

> meaning of _O(func)_

- asymptotic behavior of the function when argument goes to infinity
- describes how execution time or used memory grow with input data growing
    - important only how fast function grows, not specific function
    - _n_ and _2n_ operations algorithms have same complexity _O(n)_, so _O(n/2)_ doesn't make sense

_id_: `o_func`

> what is amortized complexity (амортизированная сложность, учётная стоимость)?

- this is time complexity if we average on a lot of cycles
- being amortized allows some cases to have long execution, but if these are rare, average complexity will be as specified

> optimization task

- calculation of cycle-independent pure functions should happen outside the cycle (_2gis_)
- we can apply one of `algorithm` functions with parallel/unsequenced execution policy (_2gis_)
- reserve `vector` size, instead of calling `push_back` if possible (_2gis_)

> is it always possible to move function evaluation outside of the cycle, even if it doesn't depend on cycle index?

- only if function is pure: same input values give same output
  - this may be not true if non-local variables affect result (`static` or global)

> integer addition faster than multiplication?

- depends on a lot of factors
- usually yes, but improvement is not worth to consider

# design patterns


> design patterns?

- these are good solutions for common programming problems

- singleton
  - one instance class
  - for example we can store configuration values in singleton class
- abstract factory
  - can create different class instances with common interface function
  - in C++ it is possible to add concrete classes with shared libraries without changing abstract factory code
- Pimpl idiom (pointer to implementation idiom) aka opaque pointer
  - allows additional separation of interface from implementation
    - Luxoft -> Citi -> `dosa` -> `dosa_publisher` -> `ProtoPublisher`
    - Qt

> iterator

- this is entity that allows iteration through elements of container
- in C++ may be not only class, but also pointer to element type (works for `vector` for example)

_id_: `iterator`


# algorithms


> what can be used as iterator for STL algorithms?

- instance of class
- raw pointer if elements are contiguous in memory (`array`, `vector`, `deque`)

> how do algorithm functions check if what they got can be used as iterator?

- there is no special check
- iterator should be fit to pass through template instantiation
- raw pointers can be used as iterators for contiguous layout containers

# unit tests

> testing frameworks

- Boost.Test
- Google Test
    - Google Mock  
      framework for imitating the rest of the system during unit tests
